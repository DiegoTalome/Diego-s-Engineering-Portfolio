Maze Stack Game
===============

Overview:
---------
This is a console-based game written in C++ using the stack data structure.
Your goal is to navigate between rooms and find the hidden treasure.

Controls:
---------
- 'w' = move up
- 's' = move down
- 'x' = enter door
- 'z' = grab treasure
- 'q' = quit game

Gameplay:
---------
Each room is implemented as a stack of tiles. The player navigates using a pointer index,
simulating movement up and down through the stack. Some tiles are doors ('/'), which lead
to the next room, and one room contains a treasure ('*').

To win, you must find the treasure and grab it by standing on it and pressing 'z'.
