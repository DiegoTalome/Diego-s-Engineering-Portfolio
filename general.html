  <h2>Welcome to My Engineering Portfolio</h2>

  <p>
    My name is Jacky Riven, and I’m currently pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
    This portfolio showcases a selection of my projects, ranging from digital logic design and embedded systems to analog circuit development and software engineering.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is structured to present not only the functionality of each project, but also to explain the design process behind them, the challenges I encountered,
    and the skills I applied and developed along the way. Each section is crafted to be accessible to both engineers and curious viewers interested in the behind-the-scenes of how systems work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The projects you’ll find here include a maze-based game written in C++ using a stack navigation system, a three-stage analog amplifier designed from scratch,
    and a modular 16-bit MIPS processor constructed using VHDL, featuring components like a register file and arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
  </p>

  <p>
    I built this portfolio as a professional presentation tool to help communicate my work during job and internship applications.
    It’s also a personal reflection space—an organized timeline of my progress and a foundation for everything I’ll continue to build.
