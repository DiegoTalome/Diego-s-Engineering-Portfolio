  <h3>Maze Stack Game!</h3>

  <p>
    This project was created as a final for CS 301 and centers around a stack-based game implemented entirely in C++.
    The player explores a maze composed of multiple rooms, using vertical navigation through stacks and horizontal transitions through doorways.
  </p>

  <p>
    The game runs in a text-based console. You can move up or down using keys 'w' and 's', enter doors using 'x', grab a treasure with 'z', and quit the game with 'q'.
    The stack structure provides a great way to simulate depth, such as tiles inside a room being accessed one layer at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The logic behind the maze is structured using the Standard Template Library (STL) stack. This allows the tiles to be pushed or popped efficiently,
    giving us natural room traversal and reset behaviors. Each room is essentially a vertical column, and your pointer navigates up or down it like a memory stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also use vectors to temporarily reverse the stack for display purposes, and simple pointer arithmetic to track the current tile the player is on.
    Rather than actual memory addresses, we use indices as abstracted pointers to simplify logic and avoid direct memory manipulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project demonstrates a solid understanding of stack operations, pointer simulation, modular logic with functions,
    and interactive loop structures ‚Äî all important foundations in computer engineering and systems programming.
